# Using Dashboards to Analyze Digital vs. Physical Library Checkouts

**Project description:** Projects for ALY 6070 â€“ Communication and Visualization for Data Analytics

### Background

For this class, I was part of a group who was provided a subset of data from the Seattle Public Library (SPL).  Each of us had to explore a separate aspect of the data and provide insights related to future budget recommendation for SPL.  I chose to explore the difference between forecasts for digital checkouts and for physical checkouts.  For two separate assignments, I had to build a dashboard in Tableau and another using R Shiny.

### Going Beyond the Coursework

Although no interactivity was required for either dashboard version, I included interactive elements in each dashboard.
